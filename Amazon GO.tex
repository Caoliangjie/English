Today I raed << Amazon GO - the Most Advanced Shopping Technoloy >>. The article make a disscusion about this technoloy. What would shopping
look like if you can walk into the store , grab what you want and just go ? In fact , the truth is yes . Amazon Go did it with no lines , no checkouts , no registers . 
\par
I wonder how does it work , and the article give me its opinion . They use computer vision , deep learning algorithy and center fusion , much like self-driving cars . Their app make it possible that users receipt is sent straight to the app and they can keep going .
\par
In a word , I really feel the widely use of deep learning and computer vision . Though my skill ability is not good enough , I won't give up . I will try my best to finish it .
