As we all know , our native smartphone has developed better than ever . Actually MIX2 is a great cheaper option for those who don't want to drop all the dollars and it's ceramic based . This idea is thought by Engadget from << Froniter tech >> . \\

Xiaomi is one of the world's most valuable privately held companies at about 20 billion dollars , and is a top smartphone maker along with Samsung , Apple and the rest . The company pulled  off a major surprise last year when it unveiled the original Mi MIX as an ear bezel-less phone . The design is just slightly than the original Mi MIX  though the update has rounded conrns and sides along with that premium ceramic back and alunminum alloy sides . It's price starts at 510 dollars , but the top editions cost 720 dollars . \\
\par
In a word , our native technoloy  has gain more international market share than others . Xiaomi is just a piece of cake , Huawei , Zhongxing , OPPO and so on , they all contribute our country's high tech outport . We will continue developing . \\
