\maketitle
\par
Hyperloop is proving to be the future of travel . This concept is put up by Elon Musk , a man who always has revolutional idea and finally makes it . His newly attempt is to build up the future transit system . \\
\par 
This technology would operate like the vaccum tubes at bank drive-thoughts or old mailroom systems . It has four keys features that set it apart from the typical transportation . The passengers capsules are propelled by electromagnetic motors . The speed is up to 760 miles per hour . The vaccum of Hyperloop can redirect air to the back of the capsule of additional propusion . And solar panels on the top of the track supply power to the periodic motors . Elon dreams of the Hyperloop being the fastest , safetest and most convenient form of travl in the world . \\
\par
In my opinion , the development of mordern transportation grow fast year by year . Benifited from the Third industrial revolution , the full running system can be automatic just with a signal . The future is lightful .
