Recently we know that Vladmir Putin was elected to be the president of Russian once more . That means America government is still unprepared for another Russian attack on the vote . Putin has been on power for  nearly 20 years , and he is still be adored by the Russian . Because the middle election of America will come soon . They are afraid of what Putin would do if the Kremlin launched an even more aggressive interference campaign than the one that roiled the 2016 presidential race . \\
\par
Actually , some of the states use paperless machine to vote . With the development of technology , the security should be strengthened . Having paper-friendly machines is hardly enough. Paper trails enable state officials to run statistically sound post-election audits of vote tallies. Yet only a handful of states require rigorous audits, with only a handful more considering them.\\

To be honest,the surest way to secure the nation’s elections is to deter attacks in the first place. On this, the country is perhaps the most behind . The newspaper said Mr. Trump’s continuing fixation on appeasing Mr. Putin may lead the Russian government to believe that it would face few serious consequences for again interfering in U.S. elections . Though we can't predict what Putin will do next . \\
