Yesterday I read the article<<Meet iPhoneX>>.What impress me most is its newly design style.There's no home button.But we can still unlock our phone with a glance.They call it Face ID.Actually this technology is pretty cool.Many people wonder if it can't recognize our faces while we are happy,angry or cross.The answer is yes.Apple use True Depth camera enables new experiences.Like bringing emojio to life by making 50 facial muscles in real time.I know this new device is not just a machine.If we can train them properly,they call it "machine learning".I think machine have more possibilities in the future.
