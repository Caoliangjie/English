Today I continue to read << Frontier Tech >> . I pick up this article << Project Loon by Google >> . It says that many of us take the Internet for granted , but large part of the world are still unconnected . Because the further the distance is , the fewer people are until eventually connectivity just stops . That's why we want to bringing the benefits of the Internet to mote people , much larger areas .  \\

How do we get the position ? We use big ballons filled with lighter - than - air gas and released up into the skies . The ballons can get the signal from ground stations connection to local Internet service providers . When it is eventually to come down , they can navigate to remote areas . \\

In my view , Internet is a part of our daily life nowadays . By exchanging message from person to person , we can get useful information easily . Thi project makes the the truth to connect more people in more places around the world . How amazing the plan is ! \\
