\par
Recently I feel that I should try to read some professional articles . I ' m interested in Deep Learning so I find a paper from << Nature >> called Deep Learning . \\
\par
This paper said that conventional machine learning techniques were limited in their ability to process natural data . Machine learning systems are used to identify objects in images , transcribe speech into text , match news items , posts or products with users interests , and select relevant results of search . \cite{name1} These applications make use of a class of techniques called Deep Learning .  \\

They try to build a new type of frameworks in this paper , so it can easily take advantages of increases in the amount of availiable computation and data . I will continue learning how it works these days . \\
